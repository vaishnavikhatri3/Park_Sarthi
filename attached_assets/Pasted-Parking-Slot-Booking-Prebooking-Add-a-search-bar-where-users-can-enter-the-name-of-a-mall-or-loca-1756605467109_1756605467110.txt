Parking Slot Booking & Prebooking

Add a search bar where users can enter the name of a mall or location.

Display a list of malls with real-time parking slot availability, e.g.:

C21 Mall → 12 slots

Treasure Island → 3 slots

Orbit Mall → Full

Users can select an available slot.

Reduce available slots dynamically after booking.

Add a “Leaving in 10 min” button to simulate a slot becoming free.

Prebooking: Users can book slots in advance. Prebooked slots reduce availability until canceled or expired.

Show visual indicators: green = available, red = full.

Implement wallet/points system for booking payments (use dummy wallet balance).

Display notifications or alerts when slots are booked or freed.

2. Mappls API Integration

After selecting a slot, open Mappls navigation to show directions to the parking spot.

Use dummy coordinates for malls initially.

Implement voice navigation with turn-by-turn instructions.

Ensure the map is responsive and works on mobile and desktop.

3. Real-Time Simulation

Use Realtime Database (Firebase or similar) to simulate slot updates across users.

All users should see updated slot availability in real-time.

4. Challan Checker

Add a section where users can enter a vehicle number.

Display dummy vehicle details:

Vehicle Number

Owner Name

Pending Challan Amount

Violation Location

Include a “Get Details & Location” button.

Example dummy data:

"MH12AB1234" → John Doe, ₹500, Pune XYZ Street

"MH14CD5678" → Jane Smith, ₹1000, Pune ABC Street

Use React state for input/output.

Show results in a clean, responsive card layout.

5. UI/UX Requirements

All interfaces must be interactive and responsive.

Include real-time slot updates, alerts, and dynamic visuals for booking/free slots.

Use dummy data so the system is fully demo-ready.

6. Implementation Notes

Provide React components for all features:

Parking Slot Booking & Prebooking

Wallet/Points System

Mappls API Navigation (voice)

Challan Checker

Ensure the code is ready to integrate into an existing project.

Use dummy data for demonstration, but the structure should support future integration with APIs and live databases.
